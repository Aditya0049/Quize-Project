A quiz is a form of game or mind sport in which players attempt to answer questions 
correctly about a certain or variety of subjects. Quizzes can be used as a brief assessment in 
education and similar fields to measure growth in knowledge, abilities, or skills. They can also 
be televised for entertainment purposes, often in a game show format.
 In an educational context, a quiz is usually a form of a student assessment, but often has 
fewer questions of less difficulty and requires less time for completion than a test. For instance, 
in a mathematics classroom, a quiz may check comprehension of a type of mathematical
exercise. Some instructors schedule a daily or weekly quiz ranging from five to thirty relatively 
easy questions for the purpose of having the students review their previous lessons before 
attending the next class.
MCQ questions wastes no time of candidate as they can quickly select the right option if they 
know the answer. Quiz website will be easy alternative for taking quiz exams as they will also 
save paper and time of institutions and candidates as well. Most of popular competitive exams 
are MCQ based so such website will be really useful.
